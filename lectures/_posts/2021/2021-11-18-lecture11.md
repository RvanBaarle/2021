In this lecture we take a first look at [Jeremy Siek's]() nano-pass compiler architecture.

Furthermore, we study how rewrite rules and strategies are composed from basic strategy combinators. The basic building blocks of transformation are matching and building terms. These are composed using combinators including sequential composition and (left) choice into more complext strategies. To define traversal strategies that apply transformations throughout a term, we define one-level traversal primitives. These can be used to define a variety of traversals, including top-down, bottom-up, and innermost.
