In this lab you make a start with compiling ChocoPy to RISC-V code using Stratego.
You translate expression statements with expressions containing constants, operators, and variables.
While it would be possible to completely compute the values of such expressions using constant folding, this is not the aim of this lab.
Rather, we want the basis for a translation of expressions using variables and function calls as well.

### A Minimial Viable Example

The following is a minimal ChocoPy program:

```
y : int = 3
1 + y
```

Aim to get the complete compiler pipeline working for this example first.
Then work on extending the various stages.

### Nano-Pass Compiler Architecture

Follow the setup of the pipeline in _Essentials of Compiling_ consisting of the following strategies:

```
compile =
  compile-cpy-to-cir
  ; compile-cir-to-rv32im
  ; compile-rv32im

compile-cpy-to-cir =
  explicate-types
  ; desugar
  ; uniquify
  ; remove-complex-operands
  ; explicate-control

compile-cir-to-rv32im =
  select-instructions-cprogram

compile-rv32im =
  assign-homes
  ; patch-instructions
```

Be sure to replace the `compile` rule in `src/compile.str2` with the above `compile` strategy.

### RISC-V Resources

Consult the following resources as documentation on the RISC-V architecture and instruction set:

* [RISC-V Reference](https://github.com/jameslzhu/riscv-card/blob/master/riscv-card.pdf) by James Zhu. Provides a concise overview of the instruction set.

* [Venus Editor](https://chocopy.org/venus.html) on ChocoPy site.

* [ChocoPy Reference Compiler](https://chocopy.org/) on the ChocoPy site. Produces RISC-V code with annotations.

* [RISC-V Specifications](https://riscv.org/technical/specifications/). The offical specification.

* [RISC-V Instruction Set Manual](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual)

* [RISC-V Assembly Programmer's Manual](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-asm-manual/blob/master/riscv-asm.md) for an overview of the instruction set.

### Prebuilt

The `prebuilt` directory of your project template should have

* The ChocoPy signature and pretty-printer
* The RV32IM signature and pretty-printer

The template should also have implementations of the ChocoPy parser and type checker.

### Compiler Testing

Develop tests in SPT to test your compiler.

```
module test

language chocopy

test 1+1 [[
1+1
]] transform "To RV32IM and execute" to "2"
```


<!-- See the slides of [Lecture 12]({{site.baseurl}}/lecture/12/) on code generation for an approach to get started. -->

<!-- ### Objectives

1. Develop tests for your compiler that explore the edge cases.

2. Define a transformation strategy that translates ChocoPy constant expressions to RISC-V code. I.e. including integer and boolean constants and operators.

3. Develop a simplification transformation that transforms expressions such that more concise code can be generated.



### Basic Compiler Pipeline

Follow the slides of [Lecture 12]({{site.baseurl}}/lecture/12) to set up a basic compiler pipeline for translating statement expressions and print the resulting value.

```
  program-to-rv32im:
    ast@Program(definitions, [stat]) -> Program(instrs2)
    where
      a := <stx-get-ast-analysis>
      ; <stat-to-instrs(|"a1", <registers>)> stat => instrs1
      ; instrs2 := <concat> [
          [PSText()]
        , instrs1
        , [Li("a0", "1"),
           Ecall()]
        ]
```

Note that you will eventually have to extend this rule to cover all of ChocoPy.

The `stat-to-instrs` strategy transforms statements. For now, we are only defining it for expression statements:

```
  stat-to-instrs(|r, regs) :
    Exp(e) -> instrs
    where <exp-to-instrs(|r, regs)> e => instrs
```

The strategy is parameterized with a register in which it expects the value of the expression to be stored and a list of registers that can be used as temporaries. For now this is defined as follows:

```  
  registers = !["t0", "t1", "t2", "t3", "t4", "t5", "t6"]
```

That is, the `t` registers can all be used as temporaries. You will probably have to adjust this in the future.




### Translating Expressions

Define a strategy that transforms expressions to lists of instructions. The example rules below show how to do this for integer constants and integer additions. These rules use registers to store the intermediate values of sub-expressions, by drawing from a list of registers. Note that this a naive approach that does not scale to arbitrary expressions. You will have to discover the limitations and figure out how to overcome those.

#### Debugging

The following strategy definition defines `exp-to-instrs` in terms of an auxiliary rule `exp-to-instrs-`:

```
  exp-to-instrs(|r, regs) =
    exp-to-instrs-(|r, regs)
    <+ (debug(!"exp-to-instr fails: "); fail)
```    

This is a useful pattern in Stratego, as it catches a possible failure of the `exp-to-instrs-` rule and reports it in the Eclipse Console. For example, this strategy will report when you apply the compiler to an operator that is not (yet) supported.

You can also debug your generated code, by creating a `.cpy` file, transforming it to an `.rv32im` file using the `Spoofax > Generation` menu, and copying the generated output to the online Venus editor, where you can use the `Simulator` tab to run your code or step through each line, and inspect the memory and registers.

#### Translating Constants

Integer constants are translated to instructions that load the constant value into a register:

```    
  exp-to-instrs-(|r, regs) :
    Int(i) -> [Li(r, i)]
```

Can other types of constants be treated similarly?

#### Translating Operators

Operators combine expressions into new expressions. In order to translate an operator, its sub-expressions should be translated recursively the lists of instructions. Furthermore, while the value of the second sub-expression is computed, the value of the first sub-expression should be stored. This typically requires a new register. Thus, integer addition can be translated as follows:

```       
  exp-to-instrs-(|r, regs@[r2 | regs']) :
    add@Add(e1, e2) -> <concat> [
        instrs1
      , instrs2
      , [Add(r, r, r2)]
    ]
    where <stx-get-ast-analysis> add => a
        ; <get-type(|a)> add => INT()
        ; <exp-to-instrs(|r, regs)> e1 => instrs1
        ; <exp-to-instrs(|r2, regs')> e2 => instrs2
```

Note that the list of registers is used to obtain a fresh register.

Define transformation rules for all operators of ChocoPy expressions.

#### Special Cases

RISC-V provides specialized instructions for some operations. For example, the `addi` instruction allows directly adding an integer constant (between -2048 and 2047) to a register. A compiler can make use of such instructions, by detecting special patterns in the source language. For example, the following rule (when listed before the general rule for addition above), detects additions with an integer constant, and translates those to applications of `addi`, avoiding the use of an extra register.

```          
  exp-to-instrs-(|r, regs) :
    add@Add(e, Int(i)) -> <concat> [
        instrs
      , [Addi(r, r, i)]
    ]
    where <gtS>(i, "-2049"); <ltS>(i, "2048")
        ; <stx-get-ast-analysis> add => a
        ; <get-type(|a)> add => INT()
        ; <exp-to-instrs(|r, regs)> e => instrs
```

Can you detect other specialized instructions and corresponding source language patterns that provide a more concise and/or faster target code?

### Simplification

To improve the result of code generation, it can be useful to transform the source language expression. For example, left-associative additions produce a better result with the rules for addition above. Another useful transformation is to type specialize the constructors of the AST, such that the analysis results are no longer needed. That is useful when applying transformations, since preserving those annotations cannot be done for all transformations. **The following `simplify-all` transformation should be invoked on the AST before invoking the compiler transformation.**

```
signature
  constructors
    AddInt : Exp * Exp -> Exp

rules

  simplify-all =
    innermost(type-specialize <+ simplify)

  type-specialize :
    add@Add(e1, e2) -> AddInt(e1, e2)
    where <stx-get-ast-analysis> add => a
        ; <get-type(|a)> add => INT()

  simplify :
    AddInt(e1, AddInt(e2, e3)) -> AddInt(AddInt(e1, e2), e3)
```

Note that the rules for translating integer additions should be adapted to reflect the change in constructors.

This simplification can include constant folding, eventually. However, do not yet include constant folding rules, since you want to test the translation of operators. That is, your code generator should be able to translate arbitrary combinations of operators, so be prepared for the general case.

Think about (and try out in the online compiler!) the differences between adding integers and concatenating strings in RISC-V. In ChocoPy, they initially both use the `Add(...)` constructor, so make sure to disambiguate them into separate constructors you will later use for code generation. The same holds for other operations, but you have to think about those yourself.

### Booleans

In ChocoPy we compile the Booleans `True` and `False` to integers in RISC-V (`1` and `0`, respectively). Implement the Boolean operators `and`, `or` and `not`, and integer comparison operators `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` (you can ignore `is` for now since it operates on objects).

You can make use of the online compiler, or the RISC-V instruction set to find the proper instructions in RISC-V.

Also implement the ternary operator `... if ... else ...`. (See [Short-circuit Boolean operations](#shortcircuit) to get an idea on how to implement it.)

### Challenges

#### Running out of registers

The approach sketched above does not generalize to arbitrary expressions.
Create test cases that require more temporary registers than are available.

Start thinking about solutions for this limitation. Two standard solutions are using the stack for temporaries (which is slow since it involves writing to and reading from memory), and register allocation (which requires a program analysis on the generated code).

#### <a name="shortcircuit"></a>Short-circuit Boolean operations.

When encountering a Boolean operation of the form `False and ...`, do we really care about the right side of the operator? Similarly, when we encounter `True or ...`?

Think about how we can use conditional jumps in RISC-V to short-circuit (any) Boolean operators. Have a look at the instruction set and online compiler.

A conditional jump in RISC-V takes a label, which represents an address in memory. In Stratego, labels can be generated using `<newname> "L" => label`. (Note that `"L"` can be anything you want, as long as it is a string.) -->
